In the `search_code` method, the value of `url_parameters[\"q\"]` is `\"symbol:abc language:java\"`. The total count returned is 1000.\r\n\r\nThen I tried:\r\n```py\r\nresults = client.search_code(query='symbol:abc', language='java language:cpp')\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis returned a total count of 1, equivalent to `https://api.github.com/search/code?q=language:java+language:cpp+symbol:abc`.\r\n\r\n### Questions\r\n1. Is this usage correct?\r\n    - Is `client.search_code(query='symbol:abc', language='java language:cpp')` equivalent to `(language:java OR language:cpp) symbol:abc`?\r\n2. Why is there a significant difference in total counts?\r\n    - GitHub Search URL: 469k\r\n    - GitHub API URL: 1\r\n    \r\nAny guidance on correctly using multiple language qualifiers with PyGitHub and understanding the discrepancy in total counts would be greatly appreciated.","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOADYVqs6HeyBB","author":{"login":"EnricoMi"},"authorAssociation":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Looking at the [implementation of `search_code`](https://github.com/PyGithub/PyGithub/blob/7266e812ed2976ea36a4303edecfe5d75522343f/github/MainClass.py#L731-L775), the `**qualifiers` arguments are appended to the `query` joined by a space.\r\n\r\nYou could put the entire query into `query`, or put the `OR` expression into `query` and add `symbol:abc` (which is awkward):\r\n\r\n1. `client.search_code(query='(language:java OR language:cpp) symbol:abc')`\r\n2. `client.search_code(query='(language:java OR language:cpp)', symbol='abc')`\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/PyGithub/PyGithub/blob/7266e812ed2976ea36a4303edecfe5d75522343f/github/MainClass.py#L731-L775","createdAt":"2024-08-07T09:08:49Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/PyGithub/PyGithub/issues/3013#issuecomment-2272993345","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDOADYVqs6IJ7rr","author":{"login":"Momo-Not-Emo"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"It seems the different number of results caused by the `symbol` qualifier","createdAt":"2024-08-12T15:36:19Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/PyGithub/PyGithub/issues/3013#issuecomment-2284305131","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDOADYVqs6IKDlL","author":{"login":"Momo-Not-Emo"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"@EnricoMi I tried both `results = client.search_code(query='(language:java OR language:cpp) symbol:abc')` and\r\n`results = client.search_code(query='(language:java OR language:cpp)', symbol='abc')`.

Ensure that the installation credentials work for mundane requests (get repo).\r\n```\r\n$ python3\r\nPython 3.11.2 (main, Feb 16 2023, 03:07:35) [Clang 14.0.0 (clang-1400.0.29.202)] on darwin\r\n>> from github import *\r\n>> with open(\"mykeyfile.pem\", \"r\") as f:\r\n...  private_key = f.read().strip()\r\n\r\n>> app_id = \"123456\" // use your application id.\r\n>> integration = github.GithubIntegration(app_id, private_key)\r\n>> installation = integration.get_repo_installation('myuser', 'my-private-repo')\r\n>> token = integration.get_access_token(installation.id).token\r\n>> g = Github(token)\r\n>> g.get_repo('myuser/my-private-repo')\r\nRepository(full_name=\"myuser/my-private-repo\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe failure\r\n\r\n```\r\n>> print('Using the same installation, I get this failure')\r\n>> installation.get_repos()\r\n<github.PaginatedList.PaginatedList object at 0x11248d450>\r\n>>> hitting_the_api_now = [r for r in installation.get_repos()]\r\nFile \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\r\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <listcomp>\r\n  File \"/users/Ubuntu/test_error/.venv/lib/python3.11/site-packages/github/PaginatedList.py\", line 56, in __iter__\r\n    newElements = self._grow()\r\n                  ^^^^^^^^^^^^\r\n  File \"/users/Ubuntu/test_error/.venv/lib/python3.11/site-packages/github/PaginatedList.py\", line 67, in _grow\r\n    newElements = self._fetchNextPage()\r\n                  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\r\n  File \"/users/Ubuntu/test_error/.venv/lib/python3.11/site-packages/github/PaginatedList.py\", line 201, in _fetchNextPage\r\n    headers, data = self.__requester.requestJsonAndCheck(\r\n                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\r\n  File \"/users/Ubuntu/test_error/.venv/lib/python3.11/site-packages/github/Requester.py\", line 398, in requestJsonAndCheck\r\n    return self.__check(\r\n           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^\r\n  File \"/users/Ubuntu/test_error/.venv/lib/python3.11/site-packages/github/Requester.py\", line 423, in __check\r\n    raise self.__createException(status, responseHeaders, output)\r\ngithub.GithubException.BadCredentialsException: 401 {\"message\": \"Bad credentials\", \"documentation_url\": \"https://docs.github.com/rest\"}\r\n```","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOADYVqs5agUDr","author":{"login":"eap"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"In case it helps, here's my environment.

What is the point of having remove_artifact() in Repository if you need to create Artifact to get its id?\r\n\r\nFunctionally, you are right. This was just a suggestion.\r\n\r\nIn principle, it would match the REST API where there is a call on the repo, specifying the id of the artifact to delete. But you may consider that the class structure in PyGithub is designed to hide this functional approach.\r\n\r\nIn practice, this is a way to simplify the code structure when you have to browse through all artifacts of a repo and delete some of them. There is a pitfall in the Github API about \"paginated\" lists. When you iterate page by page (say 100 items per page), reading the \"next page\" is not \"starting after the last returned item\", this is \"page number 2\", meaning \"starting at item number 101\". If you iterate on items without deleting or creating any, it does not make a difference. However, when you list all \"items\" (artifacts for instance), decide which should be deleted and delete them, then you have a problem. Let's take an example: in the first page (items 1 to 100), you decide to delete 10 of them. Then, moving to \"next page\" means \"start at item 101, _after the deletion_, meaning that items which were numbered 101 to 110 before deletion are missed because they are now numbered 91 to 100.\r\n\r\nThe problem is real, I ran into it with the REST API and with PyGithub `PaginatedList`. It took me some time to understand why my purge script randomly missed some artifacts and I had to run it several times to do a complete purge.\r\n\r\nSo, in practice, you need a first pass where you read the items to delete, store their id in some list. Then, during a second pass, you delete the items by id. This is [what my script does](https://github.com/tsduck/tsduck/blob/master/.github/maintenance/purge-artifacts.py) and now it always works at the first run.\r\n\r\nI also had the issue, initially, with [this script](https://github.com/tsduck/tsduck/blob/master/.github/maintenance/close-pending.py) which closes issues with a certain label (and then remove the label). Since the issues are browsed using `repo.get_issues(labels = ['close pending'])`, removing the label of one issue while browsing changes the numbering of issues with that label when the next page is transparently fetched by the iterator at some point.\r\n\r\nThis is a particularly nasty behaviour that I haven't seen documented anywhere, neither in the Github API doc nor in the PyGithub doc. Once you understand it, it makes sense. But it may take some time to understand it.\r\n\r\nIf is perfectly possible to build and store a list of instances of `Artifact` during the first pass and then invoke their `delete()` method in the second pass. I thought it would be faster and less resource-demanding to store only a list of integer ids during the first pass and then delete them by id using the instance of `Repository`.\r\n\r\nHowever, this is just the rationale for my suggestion. We can live without it and feel free to ignore it if you do not like it.","createdAt":"2022-09-28T14:53:14Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/PyGithub/PyGithub/issues/2313#issuecomment-1261034776","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDOADYVqs5LN-fC","author":{"login":"lelegard"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"Hi @lexa,\r\n\r\nI have converted my [purge-artifact script here](https://github.com/tsduck/tsduck/blob/master/.github/maintenance/purge-artifacts-new.py).

Rate limit errors (403) do not have `Retry-After` header, at least not in all situations: https://github.community/t/no-retry-after-header/184498/7.\r\n2. Not all 403 errors are retry-able (e.g. access forbidden if not authenticated), so retrying based on status code (403) only would be a bad idea. The `urllib3.util.retry.Retry` interface does not allow for checking the response message or body content, only response code: https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/pull/2500\r\n\r\nWhat I do is create a GitHub instance with a bespoke `urllib3.util.retry.Retry` class that is able to determine whether to retry based on the response content.

The default `Retry` implementation will then respect `Retry-After` headers if they exist.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/EnricoMi/publish-unit-test-result-action/blob/043296c976c53f4536194ebe3841ed720e04d496/python/publish/retry.py#L17-L76\r\n\r\n```\r\nretry = GitHubRetry(total=retries,\r\n                    backoff_factor=backoff_factor,\r\n                    allowed_methods=Retry.DEFAULT_ALLOWED_METHODS.union({'GET', 'POST'}),\r\n                    status_forcelist=list(range(500, 600)))\r\ngithub.Github(login_or_token=token, base_url=url, per_page=100, retry=retry)\r\n```\r\n","createdAt":"2022-01-09T12:27:59Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":1}}],"url":"https://github.com/PyGithub/PyGithub/issues/2113#issuecomment-1008288358","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDOADYVqs48HbSs","author":{"login":"xmo-odoo"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> I think PyGithub should throttle all requests so that rate limit errors are avoided in the first place (#1989).\r\n\r\n\"Mitigated\" is probably a better qualifier: because github publishes no guidance on notification-triggering operations, can change the rate limiting at any moment, and provides no `Retry-After` header then, there is no way to ensure the issue is avoided.\r\n\r\n","createdAt":"2022-01-10T06:40:28Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/PyGithub/PyGithub/issues/2113#issuecomment-1008579756","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDOADYVqs48IaPi","author":{"login":"EnricoMi"},"authorAssociation":"COLLABORATOR","body":"\"Mitigate\" is a better word indeed as we cannot avoid the RateLimitExceededExceptions: #2145","createdAt":"2022-01-10T12:41:10Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/PyGithub/PyGithub/issues/2113#issuecomment-1008837602","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDOADYVqs5Bmiht","author":{"login":"stale"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"This issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has not had recent activity.

But you have to check-out the total repository. This need a lots of time in a recursive style with very large repositories.\r\n\r\nI think a smarter possibility is to parse the \".gitsubmodule\" file in parent folder via PyGithub. This is the fastest option I know. To scan the total repository for a file with \"content type = submodule\" is not very effective. And need a lot of time for large repsoritories **AND a lots of API RATES**.\r\n\r\nI think I have two possibilities:\r\n- to wait for a good submodule implementation at one of the future REST API releases\r\n- to parse the \".submodules\" file via PyGithu (fast and api rate thrifty)\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?","createdAt":"2021-10-18T07:14:54Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/PyGithub/PyGithub/issues/2054#issuecomment-945433019","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDOADYVqs44Wvax","author":{"login":"s-t-e-v-e-n-k"},"authorAssociation":"COLLABORATOR","body":"It's up to GitHub what they expose via the REST API, I'm not sure what they are planning.

This seems to be a long-standing issue, reported as early as 2016 https://github.com/PyGithub/PyGithub/issues/470 and then i believe mistakenly closed. The same user also submitted a PR https://github.com/PyGithub/PyGithub/pull/471/files which looks like it would solve the issue (and does solve it in my local testing).\r\n\r\nI also think this may be some of the root cause for other open/past issues with people seeing authentication failures. It took a while of digging for me to find out that DEBUG was just enabled `isEnabledFor(logging.DEBUG)` in my environment. It does work to set logging to a higher level or disable debug with `logging.disable(logging.DEBUG)`, but that is not the ideal solution.\r\n\r\nMy particular use case is the redirect on moved/renamed repo's. This only comes into play when authentication is being used (whether it is needed or not, providing bad auth will cause the problem).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Reproduce\r\n\r\n1.  Create a repo to rename, rename the repo\r\n    https://github.com/dannyscript/testmove -> https://github.com/dannyscript/testmoved\r\n    (I'll leave that repo sitting there in case anyone wants to test against an already renamed repo)\r\n2. import and create an instance\r\n```\r\nfrom github import Github\r\ngithub_api = 'https://api.github.com'\r\nghe = Github(base_url=github_api)\r\n```\r\n3. Test\r\n```\r\nghe.get_repo('dannyscript/testmoved')\r\nOut[5]: Repository(full_name=\"dannyscript/testmoved\")  <--- Success new name\r\nghe.get_repo('dannyscript/testmove')\r\nOut[6]: Repository(full_name=\"dannyscript/testmoved\")  <--- Success old name\r\n```\r\n4. Enable logging at DEBUG level\r\n```\r\nimport logging\r\nlogging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)\r\n```\r\n5. Repeat step 3, still works, just more logs\r\n```\r\nghe.get_repo('dannyscript/testmoved') <--- Success new name\r\nDEBUG:urllib3.connectionpool:https://api.github.com:443 \"GET /repos/dannyscript/testmoved HTTP/1.1\" 200 1173\r\nDEBUG:github.Requester:GET https://api.github.com/repos/dannyscript/testmoved [...]\r\nOut[9]: Repository(full_name=\"dannyscript/testmoved\")\r\nghe.get_repo('dannyscript/testmove')  <--- Success old name\r\nDEBUG:urllib3.connectionpool:https://api.github.com:443 \"GET /repos/dannyscript/testmove HTTP/1.1\" 301 150  <--- Success on redirect\r\nDEBUG:github.Requester:GET https://api.github.com/repos/dannyscript/testmove [...]\r\nDEBUG:urllib3.connectionpool:https://api.github.com:443 \"GET /repositories/370880167 HTTP/1.1\" 200 1173\r\nDEBUG:github.Requester:GET https://api.github.com/repositories/370880167 [...]\r\nOut[10]: Repository(full_name=\"dannyscript/testmoved\")\r\n```\r\n6. Create a personal token, set up new instance\r\n```\r\ntoken = 'ghp_***'\r\nghe = Github(base_url=github_api, login_or_token=token)\r\n# Note that logging at DEBUG level is still enabled\r\n```\r\n7. Redirect fails once authentication is expected and not found on the second (redirected) request.\r\n```\r\nghe.get_repo('dannyscript/testmoved')\r\nDEBUG:urllib3.connectionpool:Starting new HTTPS connection (1): api.github.com:443\r\nDEBUG:urllib3.connectionpool:https://api.github.com:443 \"GET /repos/dannyscript/testmoved HTTP/1.1\" 200 None\r\nDEBUG:github.Requester:GET https://api.github.com/repos/dannyscript/testmoved [...]\r\nOut[13]: Repository(full_name=\"dannyscript/testmoved\")  <--- Success new name\r\nghe.get_repo('dannyscript/testmove')\r\nDEBUG:urllib3.connectionpool:https://api.github.com:443 \"GET /repos/dannyscript/testmove HTTP/1.1\" 301 150  <--- Success on redirect\r\nDEBUG:github.Requester:GET https://api.github.com/repos/dannyscript/testmove [...]\r\nDEBUG:urllib3.connectionpool:https://api.github.com:443 \"GET /repositories/370880167 HTTP/1.1\" 401 80\r\nDEBUG:github.Requester:GET https://api.github.com/repositories/370880167 [...]\r\n{\"message\":\"Bad credentials\",\"documentation_url\":\"https://docs.github.com/rest\"}  <--- Failure on old name\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"[...]/lib/python3.6/site-packages/IPython/core/interactiveshell.py\", line 2910, in run_code\r\n    exec(code_obj, self.user_global_ns, self.user_ns)\r\n  File \"<ipython-input-14-27dc175904e2>\", line 1, in <module>\r\n    ghe.get_repo('dannyscript/testmove')\r\n  File \"[...]/lib/python3.6/site-packages/github/MainClass.py\", line 325, in get_repo\r\n    \"GET\", \"%s%s\" % (url_base, full_name_or_id)\r\n  File \"[...]/lib/python3.6/site-packages/github/Requester.py\", line 319, in requestJsonAndCheck\r\n    verb, url, parameters, headers, input, self.__customConnection(url)\r\n  File \"[...]/lib/python3.6/site-packages/github/Requester.py\", line 342, in __check\r\n    raise self.__createException(status, responseHeaders, output)\r\ngithub.GithubException.BadCredentialsException: 401 {\"message\": \"Bad credentials\", \"documentation_url\": \"https://docs.github.com/rest\"}\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Environment\r\nMac\r\npython 3.6.8\r\nI have tested on PyGithub version 1.55 (current), but that example may have been on 1.51 in case any of the stacktrace line numbers look weird","comments":[{"id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg0OTMwNDIyMw==","author":{"login":"s-t-e-v-e-n-k"},"authorAssociation":"COLLABORATOR","body":"That's a brilliant point, thank you for the in-depth analysis.

Especially for docker containers, this means including a number of packages that might not have been included originally. For example, my docker container base was `python:3.9-alpine`. I didnt install any compile tools, and thus when `pip install PyGithub==1.55` is run, it fails.\r\n\r\nI needed to add a step to install `gcc`, `musl-dev`, and `libffi-dev` via `apk` beforehand for pip to pass.\r\n\r\nI think this should probably be called out in the documentation as a new dependency and possibly a new step if someone does not yet have the proper build tools installed wherever `PyGithub` is targeted for installation.\r\n\r\nEDIT: I understand this is a `pynacl` issue. `pynacl` seems to have pretty limited wheel builds and for latest python at least, they do not build wheels with either the `none` or `linux_x86_64` tags.

Here is the error message: \r\n\r\n\"github.GithubException.UnknownObjectException: 404 {\"message\": \"Not Found\", \"documentation_url\": \"https://docs.github.com/enterprise/2.22/rest/reference/git#create-a-tree\"}\"\r\n\r\nMy code:\r\n`\r\nfrom github import Github\r\nfrom github import InputGitTreeElement\r\nimport datetime\r\n\r\ntoken = \"<my token>\"\r\ng = Github(login_or_token=token)\r\nrepo = g.get_repo('ohurtubise/PyGit') \r\nfileName = \"Processed-Taxonomy_master.json\"\r\ncommitMessage = \"Updated Taxonomy {}\".format(datetime.date.today())\r\nbranch_ref = repo.get_git_ref('heads/master')\r\nbranch_sha = branch_ref.object.sha\r\nbase_tree = repo.get_git_tree(branch_sha)\r\nelement_list = list()\r\ndata = open('taxonomy.json').read()\r\nelement_list.append(InputGitTreeElement(fileName,'100644','blob',data))\r\ntree = repo.create_git_tree(element_list)\r\nparent = repo.get_git_commit(branch_sha)\r\ncommit = repo.create_git_commit(commitMessage, tree, [parent])\r\nbranch_ref.edit(commit.sha)\r\n`\r\ntaxonomy.json is the file being pushed.\r\nI get the 404 error after trying \"tree = repo.create_git_tree(element_list)\"\r\nI also tried \"tree = repo.create_git_tree(element_list, base_tree)\", but still same error.

Now, with the proposed change of moving the method to `Repository` object, the process will become like so:\r\n1. Instantiate a `GithubIntegration` object and get the JWT.\r\n2. Use the JWT to instantiate the `Github` object.\r\n4. Get the specific installation for the repository using `get_installation_by_repo()`\r\n5. Get the ID of the installation.\r\n6.

I originally found this while using <https://github.com/karlicoss/ghexport/issues/4>, you can see the process of debugging it in that issue.\r\n\r\nI've debugged this quite a bit in the above issue, created <https://github.com/seanbreckenridge/pygithub_requests_error> which has code that runs in a virtualenv which causes the error *on my machine*. Strangely, @karlicoss, who I debugged this with doesn't have the same error.\r\n\r\nSee the [log file with errrors](https://github.com/seanbreckenridge/pygithub_requests_error/blob/master/log.txt), for [this script](https://github.com/seanbreckenridge/pygithub_requests_error/blob/master/run), which runs:\r\n\r\n- a basic `curl` with the token, which succeeds ([link](https://github.com/seanbreckenridge/pygithub_requests_error/blob/master/curl_test.sh))\r\n-  `PyGithub` which fails ([link](https://github.com/seanbreckenridge/pygithub_requests_error/blob/master/pygithub_requests_fails.py))\r\n- `requests` which fails ([link](https://github.com/seanbreckenridge/pygithub_requests_error/blob/master/requests_fails.py))\r\n- subclassed `PyGithub` with `httpx` [which succeeds](https://github.com/seanbreckenridge/pygithub_requests_error/blob/a9df0bcbf91b321e068ca591e5e6b91b804fca16/log.txt#L283-L296). ([link](https://github.com/seanbreckenridge/pygithub_requests_error/blob/master/httpx_subclass_succeeds.py))\r\n\r\nThis seems to be a `requests` error, since even just requesting something basic to github with the python `requests` module (without `PyGithub` at all) fails (see [`./requests_fails.py`](https://github.com/seanbreckenridge/pygithub_requests_error/blob/master/requests_fails.py)), when the analogous `curl` command works fine.\r\n\r\nSo I'm not sure if this should be classified as a `PyGithub` error, or a `requests` error.\r\n\r\nSee <https://github.com/karlicoss/ghexport/issues/4#issuecomment-693694338>; in which I use `pdb` to step into right before the request is made (in `PyGithub.Requester`). If I make the request with the `requests` module, it fails. If I make it with `httpx`, it succeeds.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, I can subclass the `PyGithub.Requester` `HTTPSRequestsConnectionClass` to use [`httpx`](https://github.com/encode/httpx), and then `PyGithub` works fine. (See [`httpx_subclass_succeeds.py`](https://github.com/seanbreckenridge/pygithub_requests_error/blob/master/httpx_subclass_succeeds.py) and the output [here](https://github.com/seanbreckenridge/pygithub_requests_error/blob/a9df0bcbf91b321e068ca591e5e6b91b804fca16/log.txt#L283-L296)).\r\n\r\nI suspect this is an issue with `requests`, though I'm not sure how no one else has had this issue. Apologies if this should have been posted to the `requests` module instead, but I'm not sure how to debug this any further.\r\n","comments":[{"id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcxNzY4ODY2MQ==","author":{"login":"s-t-e-v-e-n-k"},"authorAssociation":"COLLABORATOR","body":"I would also file an issue with requests, since we are dependant on them.","createdAt":"2020-10-28T04:32:07Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/PyGithub/PyGithub/issues/1700#issuecomment-717688661","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcxNzY4OTc3OQ==","author":{"login":"purarue"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"Will do so","createdAt":"2020-10-28T04:36:36Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/PyGithub/PyGithub/issues/1700#issuecomment-717689779","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgyNjM5MzA4NA==","author":{"login":"purarue"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"Sorry for the delay, submitted a minimal example to [psf/requests](https://github.com/psf/requests/issues/5801)","createdAt":"2021-04-25T21:30:29Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":1}}],"url":"https://github.com/PyGithub/PyGithub/issues/1700#issuecomment-826393084","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDOADYVqs41ysLd","author":{"login":"purarue"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"This has been resolved; the cause was a `.netrc` file interfering with the login/[`trust_env`](https://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/api/#requests.Session.trust_env) - see [here](https://github.com/psf/requests/issues/5801#issuecomment-901610012)","createdAt":"2021-08-20T07:03:22Z","includesCreatedEdit":true,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[{"content":"HOORAY","users":{"totalCount":1}}],"url":"https://github.com/PyGithub/PyGithub/issues/1700#issuecomment-902480605","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2020-09-21T19:40:05Z","number":1700,"state":"CLOSED","title":"403 error for otherwise functional token","url":"https://github.com/PyGithub/PyGithub/issues/1700"},{"author":{"id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NTk4NDI2","is_bot":false,"login":"mahendra03","name":"Mahendra Rathore"},"body":"","comments":[],"createdAt":"2020-09-21T18:07:36Z","number":1698,"state":"CLOSED","title":"Code check","url":"https://github.com/PyGithub/PyGithub/issues/1698"},{"author":{"id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MjE2Njk4","is_bot":false,"login":"latacora-tomekr","name":""},"body":"Can we add `organization.get_installations()` to the [Organization](https://pygithub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/github_objects/Organization.html#) model?\r\n\r\nGET `/orgs/{org}/installations`\r\n\r\nhttps://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/orgs#list-app-installations-for-an-organization","comments":[],"createdAt":"2020-09-17T19:24:29Z","number":1694,"state":"CLOSED","title":"Implement \"List app installations for an organization\"","url":"https://github.com/PyGithub/PyGithub/issues/1694"},{"author":{"id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDUwMzgx","is_bot":false,"login":"carlescufi","name":"Carles Cuf√≠"},"body":"When running a GitHub Action, the path `/github/workflow/event.json` typically points to the webhook event payload.
